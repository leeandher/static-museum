## Personal Site v1.0
Welcome to my site's repo!

Here you can find all of the client-side accessible files for my personal site. I use this repository for version control and a better way to display my code.

I'm always learning new tricks and helpful technologies so there is a lot I would fix about the site. For one, I wish I'd started learning React before actually starting development, because that would have been really useful. That being said, every project is a learning experience, and after a while, when I get to a site overhaul, there will be something else I've learned along the way to aid my experience.

Anyway, peruse at your leisure, open a PR if there's a mistake you see somewhere, and be sure to check out the live site over at https://leander.xyz.
